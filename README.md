# Desciption

Plant database with search. Mainly for toxicity/culinary/medical information.

# TODO

- Search/filter
- Show individual plant information
- Fancy layout
- Support for other devices
- Add plant information

# Installation

1. Install [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
2. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
3. Run `yarn` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies
4. Create an empty file called CNAME in the root of the project (`touch CNAME` in your terminal or `echo "" > CNAME` in your command prompt).

# How to run

Run `yarn start`

Now you will have two servers (open them in your browser):

- <http://localhost:4000/> for the database server, automagically serving db.json
- <http://localhost:3000/> for the client server, serving the app - with auto-build when saving Elm files
